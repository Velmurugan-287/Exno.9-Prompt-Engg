## Aim

To investigate and understand how various prompting techniques influence AI-generated video content, including animations, visual effects, and video summaries, by experimenting with different prompt styles and models.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Familiarize with Video Generation Models**  
   Research and select AI tools capable of generating videos from text prompts. Common platforms include Runway Gen-2, Synthesia, Pictory, and DeepBrain. Understand the features, supported prompt types, and limitations of each model.

2. **Create Basic Video Prompts**  
   Start by writing simple prompts describing general scenes or actions to generate short video clips.  
   *Example:* “A person walking in a park.”

3. **Refine Prompts with Details**  
   Add specifics such as clothing, environment, weather, and accompanying elements to create more descriptive prompts.  
   *Example:* “A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky and a dog running beside them.”

4. **Incorporate Time and Motion Aspects**  
   Introduce dynamic elements like timing, camera movement, and transitions to simulate realistic or stylized motion.  
   *Example:* “A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing sky colors.”

5. **Test Different Video Styles**  
   Experiment with prompts targeting various styles: animation, cinematic shots, live-action, or artistic renderings.  
   *Example:* “An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and bustling crowds.”

6. **Iterate and Refine Prompts**  
   Analyze generated videos, identify areas for improvement, and adjust prompts to enhance pacing, transitions, and motion consistency.  
   *Example:* “A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on wet streets during a high-speed chase.”

7. **Generate Multiple Variations**  
   Create different versions of the same prompt with slight wording changes to compare output variations in style, sequence, and quality.

8. **Save and Compare Outputs**  
   Store generated videos for side-by-side analysis to understand how prompt phrasing impacts video generation results.

## Procedure

- Select an AI video generation platform (e.g., Runway Gen-2).
- Prepare a list of sample prompts progressing from simple to complex.
- Generate videos using each prompt.
- Document observations regarding video quality, style, motion, and adherence to prompt.
- Modify prompts based on initial outputs and re-generate.
- Repeat the process for multiple models if available.
- Compare and analyze differences in outputs generated by different prompt styles and AI tools.

## Example Prompts and Observations for AI Video Generation

### 1. Simple Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"A dog running in a park."

**Expected Output:**  
A short clip showing a generic dog running, minimal background details, straightforward animation.

**Observation:**  
Basic action with little context or stylistic nuance. Good for quick, generic scenes but lacks atmosphere or storytelling.

---

### 2. Detailed Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"A golden retriever joyfully running through a snowy field at sunset, with soft golden light and snowflakes falling gently."

**Expected Output:**  
Rich textures showing fur details, warm light contrast with cold snow, atmospheric effects like falling snowflakes.

**Observation:**  
The added detail improves visual richness and emotional engagement, setting a mood for the scene.

---

### 3. Temporal & Scene Sequence Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"Scene 1: A young woman walking alone on a beach at sunset. Scene 2: She discovers a message in a bottle washed ashore. Scene 3: She opens the bottle and smiles softly."

**Expected Output:**  
A short multi-scene video with smooth transitions, narrative flow, changing camera angles, and emotional tone.

**Observation:**  
Enables storytelling through scene segmentation, making the video feel cinematic and purposeful.

---

### 4. Style and Genre Filter Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"A robot wandering through a rainy, neon-lit futuristic cityscape at night, inspired by Blade Runner aesthetics."

**Expected Output:**  
Visually stylized video with dark, moody tones, reflections on wet surfaces, and neon glows creating a cyberpunk vibe.

**Observation:**  
Applying genre-specific style cues shapes the video’s atmosphere and audience perception dramatically.

---

### 5. Camera Direction & Cinematography Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"A slow-motion close-up of a basketball player dunking, filmed with a spinning camera from below."

**Expected Output:**  
Dramatic slow-motion clip with dynamic camera motion, capturing athletic details and emphasizing action intensity.

**Observation:**  
Simulates real-world cinematography techniques, adding professionalism and visual interest.

---

### 6. Emotion & Action Tags Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"A terrified girl running through a dark forest, chased by shadowy figures, in a horror movie style."

**Expected Output:**  
Dark, suspenseful visuals with fast-paced motion, eerie lighting, and emotionally charged atmosphere.

**Observation:**  
Conveys urgency and fear through tone and movement, engaging viewers emotionally.
